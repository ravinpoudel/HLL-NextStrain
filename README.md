# HLL-NextStrain
## Project Overview: Comparing Flu Strains Using HyperLogLog and k-mer Analysis

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to compare a new flu strain with existing strains by leveraging the HyperLogLog (HLL) algorithm to efficiently estimate the number of unique k-mers in genomic sequences. This method allows for quick and memory-efficient similarity analysis of large-scale genomic data.

### Background
HyperLogLog is a probabilistic data structure used for cardinality estimation, which provides an efficient way to count the number of unique elements in a dataset. In the context of genomic analysis, k-mers (subsequences of length k) are commonly used to represent DNA sequences. By comparing the HLL representations of k-mer sets from different strains, we can estimate the Jaccard similarity between these sets, helping us understand the genetic relationship between different flu strains.

### Workflow

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Download and store genomic sequences of existing flu strains in FASTA format.

2. **HyperLogLog Construction for Existing Strains:**
   - Extract k-mers from the sequences of existing flu strains.
   - Construct HLLs from these k-mers.
   - Save the HLLs to files for future comparisons.

3. **Processing New Strain:**
   - Extract k-mers from the genomic sequence of a new flu strain.
   - Construct an HLL from these k-mers.

4. **Comparison and Analysis:**
   - Load the precomputed HLLs of existing strains.
   - Compare the HLL of the new strain with each of the existing strains' HLLs to estimate the Jaccard similarity.
   - Output the similarity results, indicating the genetic relationship between the new strain and each existing strain.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Extract k-mers:**
   - Generate all possible k-mers from a given sequence. The length of k-mers (k) is typically set to 31, which provides a good balance between specificity and computational efficiency.

2. **Create HyperLogLog from Sequence:**
   - For each sequence, extract k-mers and update the HLL data structure with these k-mers. The HLL will efficiently estimate the number of unique k-mers.

3. **Save and Load HLLs:**
   - Save the HLLs to files, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval. This step is crucial for comparing new strains with precomputed HLLs without reprocessing the entire dataset.

4. **Compare HLLs Using Jaccard Similarity:**
   - The Jaccard similarity between two HLLs provides an estimate of the overlap between the k-mer sets of two sequences. Higher similarity indicates a closer genetic relationship.

### Code Overview
The provided Python script implements the above workflow, with functions for extracting k-mers, creating and saving HLLs, and comparing HLLs to estimate genetic similarities.

- **`extract_kmers(sequence, k)`:** Generates k-mers from a sequence.
- **`create_hll_from_sequence(sequence, k=31)`:** Constructs an HLL from k-mers of a sequence.
- **`load_existing_hlls(hll_dir)`:** Loads precomputed HLLs from files.
- **`save_hll(hll, filename)`:** Saves an HLL to a file.
- **`compare_with_existing_strains(new_hll, existing_hlls)`:** Compares a new strain's HLL with existing HLLs and estimates Jaccard similarities.
- **`main()`:** Orchestrates the workflow of creating, saving, loading, and comparing HLLs.

### Applications
- **Epidemiological Studies:** Quickly identify the genetic similarity between new and existing flu strains, aiding in tracking and understanding the spread of the virus.
- **Vaccine Development:** Identify potential candidates for vaccine development by understanding the genetic differences between circulating strains.
- **Genomic Research:** Efficiently handle large-scale genomic data, providing a scalable solution for comparing genetic sequences.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates an efficient and scalable approach to genomic sequence comparison using HyperLogLog and k-mer analysis. By leveraging probabilistic data structures, we can perform rapid and memory-efficient similarity analysis, providing valuable insights into the genetic relationships between flu strains.
